# Fun with React

This is a demonstration of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) using the [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) pattern with [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) stores.

Components are written in [JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jsx), while the rest of the app is written in [Coffeescript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript).

[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) is used for styling, with local styles written in [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus).

[Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) is used for the build.

## Usage

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

*Note: See the `/gulp` directory for more build options*
